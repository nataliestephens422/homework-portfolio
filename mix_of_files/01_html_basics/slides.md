#### Learning Objectives
---
By the end of today's class, you will be able to...

- Apply HTML tags like `<html><head><!DOCTYPE html><body>` to a web page and experiment with html tags

- Describe the DOM and draw a simple DOM tree

- Have a better understanding of how the internet displays web pages through the browser

- Create and link to an external style sheet from your HTML file


#### <u>Agenda</u>

1. Conceptual history, and role of HTML & CSS in web development

2. Review HTML Tags & CSS Selectors

3. Practice adding structure using HTML (code-along)

4. Practice adding an External Stylesheet to the html (code-along)

5. Lab Time to practice (independent practice)!


## **Conceptual Overview**

**As developers, we need to...**

- Understand where front-end development fits into the bigger picture

- Understand the components of a site on the front-end (html, css, JS)

- Understand where browsers fit into the bigger picture and how to communicate with them



### Turn and talk

###### 1989: TBL invents the Web with HTML as its publishing language at CERN
----
- Tim was trying to solve the problem of loss of information

- **HyperText** existed but only on one computer (ability to link one document to another)

- **TCP/IP existed** - * a transportation system for data*

- **Domain Name System existed** - * like a phonebook of computer addresses*





###The Inspiration
---

- Tim imagined what it would be like to combine HyperText idea with the Internet

- so you could jump from one document on one machine, to another document on another

*What would this look like if everybody could contribute and access these documents?*


###A world wide web
![TBL ](../../img/extra/01/web.png)


##The proposal
<iframe width="1000px" height="400px" src="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html"></iframe>



###The Proposal
---
Tim knew there needed to be a
-  shared method for sending/receiving data across the web
-  common convention for structuring the data

To achieve this, he created `http` and `html`


### First website - source code

### HyperText Markup Language
---
####**What is HTML?**

**HyperText**: text which contains links to other texts

**Markup**: a semantic way to describe a document separate from its content

`<h1>Hello!</h1>`

## HTML HISTORY
---
### Conventions are crucial!

## **Components of the front-end**
---
### Conceptual Overview

**HTML**
defines the content (the bones)

**CSS**
assigns the style (the skin)

**JavaScript**
adds the functionality (the brain)

![](../../img/extra/jsvenn.jpg)


## Components of the front-end
---
### Conceptual Overview

![](../../img/extra/htmlcssjsstack.jpg)

Note:
Structure & Content
Flavored of the day: HTML5
Open Standards: W3C (World Wide Consortium - www.w3.org)
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) = Styling & Layout
JavaScript (ECMAScript) = Behavior


###  Separation of content, structure and style
---
#### Big picture concept/theme

### Separation of content, structure and style
---
#### Big picture concept/theme

![](../../img/extra/carpainted.jpg)


### Content vs. Structure vs. Style
---
#### Big picture concept/theme

- content (text, images, videos) => **steel**

- content with markup (HTML code) => **frame**

- content with markup & css => **painted vehicle**


### Stop and Jot
---
Can you think of any other real-world examples where we see a similar separation of content, structure and style?


#### **What happens when I "Google" something?**

![](../../img/extra/internet.jpg)

Note:

- You are asking your computer to retrieve a particular **file**, from a particular **server**, using a particular **protocol**
- It requests the IP address from a **D**omain **N**ame **S**ervice server
  - It does this by sending a **packet** of information (destination, origin, subect, content)
- Computer sends it down ethernet or wifi to another computer (likely cable company), then another...until it reaches its destination (**Internet Protocol**), which then sends back a response ( the requested file )
- All information is broken into packets when it leaves and are reassembled when received (**T**ransmisision **C**ontrol **P**rotocol)
- Have students CURL http://www.google.com, copy/paste into Sublime, then view in the browser
- Have students CURL another website


#### When you click a link

- Your computer requests a resource from a server (a computer with particular software, hardware etc.)

- Your computer receives a response which contains HTML

- Browser reads the HTML and displays it to us

- HTTP is the set of procedures that makes this communication possible



## **What is web development?**
---
- The creation and management of both websites and web-based applications

- Made up of the Front-end and Back-end

- Most Developers will try to convince you that it is magic, but it is mainly editing text files (coding / programming), and solving problems


## What is web development?
---

![](../../img/extra/01/webd.png)


### What is the front end?
---

- The Front-end is what the user sees
- It powers the visuals and interactions of the web
- It is meant to be pretty, but doesn't always happen that way
- Made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript


## What is the backend?
---
- It is what goes on behind the scenes
- Consists of databases, servers etc.
- Lots of different languages can be used, like:
  - Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
  - PHP
  - Python
  - C++
  - ..and more


### Exit Tickets
---
  **What is JavaScript?**

  A cross-platform, object-oriented

 **Is there a tutorial for navigating GitHub.com?**

  Yes!

  https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/


#### <u>Workflow Routine!</u>

  - Pull from Repo

  - Copy the 01__html_basics folder from **fewd_sm_26** into your **workspace** folder

  - Open up your FEWD project in Sublime on one half of your screen

  - Open up Google Chrome in the other half


  #### <u>



## Let's start coding!

- Go ahead and open Sublime and Google Chrome

####HTML Anatomy
### **Elements** - building blocks

![HTML Syntax](../../img/unit_1/tags.png)


#### HTML Anatomy
---
### **Attributes** - additional info about elements

![HTML Syntax](../../img/unit_1/tags_attributes.png)

Note:
Attributes provide additional info about elements


###HTML Elements
---
#### Headings

```
<h1> . . . </h1> <!-- largest heading -->
<h2> . . . </h2>
<h3> . . . </h3>
<h4> . . . </h4>
<h5> . . . </h5>
<h6> . . . </h6> <!-- smallest heading -->
```



### HTML Elements
---
####**Text Elements**
```
    <p> This is a paragraph </p>

    <code> This is some computer code </code>
```
Note:
- markup is about annotating our content
- notice how the tags are describing the type of content enclosedâ€¦this idea is reinforced with HTML5, semantic markup


### HTML Elements
---
#### Unordered list

```
<ul></ul> -> unordered list element
<li></li> -> list element

<!-- Used together like this... -->

<ul>
	<li>List item 1</li> <!-- an example of one tag in another -->
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 1</li>
</ul>
```


###HTML elements
---
####Links

```
 <a href="#"> Link </a>
```


## HTML/CSS Basics (review)

#### HTML Anatomy
---
What is the basic structure of an HTML document?

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- `<html>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  - `<head>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
    - `<title></title>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
  - `</head>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
  - `<body>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->
  - `</body>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->
- `</html>`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" -->


#### HTML Anatomy
---
What is the basic structure of an HTML document?
```
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tells browser which version of HTML -->
<html>		  <!-- root element of the document -->
  <head>        <!-- important information, but not visible content goes here -->
    <title></title>     <!-- only required element in the head -->
  </head>
  <body>         <!-- contains our visible content -->
   <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

```
Note:
Let's add this structure to the FEWD Outline document


###Document Object Model


## Stop and Jot
---
Take 1 -2 minutes to brainstorm what you remember about the DOM from the reading for today


####What is the DOM?
---
*The HTML DOM is an application programming interface (api) that defines*:

- The HTML elements as **objects**
- The **properties** of all HTML elements
- The **methods** to access all HTML elements
- The **events** for all HTML elements
---
In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to **get**, **change**, add, **or** **delete** HTML elements.


#### Document Object Model
---
It represents elements as a hierarchy of nodes
![GeneralAssemb.ly](../../img/extra/domtree.gif)


#### **Let's explore the DOM**

**Open up the console** **by doing the following:**

View -> Developer Tools -> Console (cmd+option+j on Mac)

| CSS Property          | CSS Value options (choose one) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| background            | blue, green,red, yellow, black |
| font-size             | 12px, 16px, 18px, 24px         |
| color  (*font color*) | blue, green, red, yellow black |


##INDEPENDENT PRACTICE!

##Cookie Recipe


> Here's the situation...
>
> You have come across your grandma's recipe for chocolate chip cookies...but there is a problem!  The recipe has no structure or styling!
> Your challenge is to:

- Use HTML tags to add structure (use whatever tags you think are best!)
- Use CSS to add style to achieve the desired look described in the readme.md
