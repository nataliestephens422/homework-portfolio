      <p>
       For my final project, I am going to build a website that is an interactive Q+A generator. The user will be able to ask a question and using JS and JQuery it will generate an answer at random. The idea behind it is to "Stump Trump," so the user will ask something and the reply will be something obserd that Trump has said. There will be some sort of graphic as well.
